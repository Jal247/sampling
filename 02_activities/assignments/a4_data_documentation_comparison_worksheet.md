| Sample type                                           | Cross-sectional design using a probability sample, Stratified random sampling  |  The online sample for the 2019 Canadian Election Study was composed of a two-wave panel with a modified rolling-cross section during the campaign period and a post-election recontact wave.    |                                                                                             |
| Sample size                                           | Field sample size = 50,000, email sent = 40,000 and expected response size: 24,000 | Campaign Period Survey: 37,822 respondents. Post-Election Survey: 10,340 respondents  |                                                                                             |
| Target population                                     | Individuals aged 15 years and older living in the ten provinces of Canada excluding Full-time residents of institutions |  Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older  |                                                                                             |
| Sampling frame                                        | Combines landline and cellular telephone numbers linked to the Census and other administrative data sources. Records are group of one or more telephone numbers associated with a single address |  The samplewaves was obtained through Qualtrics panels, with stratification by region, gender, and age. Sampling was conducted online  |                                                                                             |
| Survey mode(s)                                        | Electronic questionnaire, CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing), No proxy reporting allowed |  Online Survey   |                                                                                             |
| Timeline                                              |  Reference period: 12 months prior to the interview date.Collection period: September to December, every 5 years. For 2018 GSS: September 4, 2018, to December 28, 2018 |  Campaign Period Survey: September 13th t0 October 21st, 2019 . And Post-Election Survey: October 24th to November 11th, 2019 .
                                           |                                                                                             |
| Response rate                                    | 41.9% overall                                  |  Pre-election survey: 37,822. Post-Election Survey :10,340  |                                                                |
| Weights                                               |  WGHT_PER: Basic weighting factor to ensure estimates are representative of the target population. In addition to the estimation weights, bootstrap weights have been used for the purpose of design-based variance estimation. |  Weights have been created for the dataset using an iterative "raking'' process to adjust all, gender, age group, and education level discrepancies, with data taken from the 2016 Canadian Census. A maximum of 200 iterations were completed. The dataset includes the weights produced as 4 variables, depending on which portion of the sample is being used  |                                                                                             |
| Data processing                                       | Utilized SSPE processing steps for structured editing and monitoring. Error detection: Automated and manual edits at micro and macro levels. CATI system ensured flow and range validity during interviews.   Imputation: Mean Donor imputation used for missing donor records.   Quality assurance: Cross-tabulations and data validation with similar sources. Confidentiality maintained via G-Confid for suppression of sensitive information. |                                              |                                                                                             |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            | Cleaning:  CATI system performed real-time checks for questionnaire flow, range validation, and consistency during interviews. Additional checks for family relationships, age consistency, and flow edits at the data processing stage. Data with unresolved issues during interviews were flagged and resolved at the head office.        Imputation: Missing values imputed using donor records selected based on similarity via a scoring system. Nine-step imputation process: Personal and family income imputed first. Formal and informal volunteering variables followed. Donation-related variables handled last. Mean imputation used when no suitable donor was available. Linked tax records (T1FF) used for income data when available (81.9% for personal income, 81.7% for family income).                                                                                          |                                             |                                                                                             |
| Sources of error                                      |  Sampling Errors: Result from using a sample rather than a full census. Variability assessed using bootstrap weights for design-based variance estimation. Non-Sampling Errors:  1. Coverage Errors:Exclusion of households without telephones or unlinked addresses. 2. Non-Response Errors:Non-response at household and individual levels. Adjustments made to weights to minimize bias. 3. Response Errors:Inaccurate or incomplete responses from participants. 4. Processing Errors: Mistakes during data editing, coding, or processing. |                                             |                                                                                             |
| Limitations, known biases                             | Households without telephones are excluded, potentially introducing coverage bias. Income data may lack precision due to reliance on tax linkage and imputation for missing data. Non-response bias reduced by adjustments but may still affect certain estimates. Volunteers were oversampled (rejective sampling), which could over-represent their characteristics in analyses.  |                                             |                                                                                             |
