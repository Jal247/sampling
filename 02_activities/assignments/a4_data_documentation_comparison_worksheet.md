|----------------|:--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample type                                           | Cross-sectional design using a probability sample, Stratified random sampling  |  The online sample for the 2019 Canadian Election Study was composed of a two-wave panel with a modified rolling-cross section during the campaign period and a post-election recontact wave.    |   Dietary Analysis: Convenience sampling (bats were caught in the wild using mist nets).   Behavioural Experiments: Experimental sampling (observations of captive bats in controlled conditions).  |
| Sample size                                           | Field sample size = 50,000, email sent = 40,000 and expected response size: 24,000 | Campaign Period Survey: 37,822 respondents. Post-Election Survey: 10,340 respondents  |   112 bats caught, 38 guano samples analyzed.  23 behavioral attacks recorded with synchronized video and calls.   |
| Target population                                     | Individuals aged 15 years and older living in the ten provinces of Canada excluding Full-time residents of institutions |  Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older  |  Glossophaga soricina bats in Costa Rica.   |
| Sampling frame                                        | Combines landline and cellular telephone numbers linked to the Census and other administrative data sources. Records are group of one or more telephone numbers associated with a single address |  The samplewaves was obtained through Qualtrics panels, with stratification by region, gender, and age. Sampling was conducted online  |   Wild bats from √Årea de Conservaci√≥n de Guanacaste and a captive colony at the University of Bristol.   |
| Survey mode(s)                                        | Electronic questionnaire, CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing), No proxy reporting allowed |  Online Survey   |   DNA analysis of guano and video-audio recordings of behavior.   |
| Timeline                                              |  Reference period: 12 months prior to the interview date.Collection period: September to December, every 5 years. For 2018 GSS: September 4, 2018, to December 28, 2018 |  Campaign Period Survey: September 13th t0 October 21st, 2019 . And Post-Election Survey: October 24th to November 11th, 2019 |  Field study: 7 weeks (May‚ÄìJuly 2009).  Behavioral experiments: 9 days.    |
| Response rate                                    | 41.9% overall                                  |  Pre-election survey: 37,822. Post-Election Survey :10,340  |  34% of bats provided usable guano samples.  |
| Weights                                               |  WGHT_PER: Basic weighting factor to ensure estimates are representative of the target population. In addition to the estimation weights, bootstrap weights have been used for the purpose of design-based variance estimation. |  The data were adjusted (weighted) to make sure the results matched Canada‚Äôs population based on region, age, gender, and education. Data from the 2016 Canadian Census was used for this adjustment.  |   Not applied   |
| Data processing                                       | After data collection, the responses were checked for errors and inconsistencies. Software and manual checks were used to ensure the answers made sense and followed the correct order | Removing incomplete or duplicate responses.  Taking out answers that were too fast or had mistakes (e.g., mismatched postal codes).  Flagging low-quality responses for review.  Adjusting (weighting) the data to match Canada‚Äôs population for fair results. | DNA sequenced to identify prey.   Videos and echolocation analyzed for attack type and call parameters.  |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            | C Data Cleaning: Any mistakes or gaps in the data were fixed, such as verifying relationships or correcting flow issues in responses.  Experts reviewed and cleaned up the data before analysis.   Imputation:  Missing data was filled in using information from similar respondents. For income, data was taken from government tax records to make sure it was accurate.  |   Data cleaning involved:  Removing incomplete or duplicate surveys, Deleting responses that were too quick or had errors, Flagging low-quality answers for review   |  Excluded poor-quality guano samples and unsynchronized recordings.   |
| Sources of error                                      |  Sampling Errors: Result from using a sample rather than a full census. Variability assessed using bootstrap weights for design-based variance estimation. Non-Sampling Errors:  1. Coverage Errors:Exclusion of households without telephones or unlinked addresses. 2. Non-Response Errors:Non-response at household and individual levels. Adjustments made to weights to minimize bias. 3. Response Errors:Inaccurate or incomplete responses from participants. 4. Processing Errors: Mistakes during data editing, coding, or processing. | Sampling Errors: The people surveyed might not perfectly represent all Canadians, especially those who don‚Äôt use the internet. Other Errors: Some people may have misunderstood or misreported their answers.  |  Limited prey reference sequences.  Captive bats might not mimic wild behavior.  |
| Limitations, known biases                             | Excluding Certain Groups: People without telephones or who couldn‚Äôt be reached by phone were left out, which might lead to some bias.  Volunteer Bias: People who volunteer more might have been more likely to respond, so the survey results may lean towards those who give more time or money.  Income Accuracy: Even though tax records helped fill in missing income data, some underreporting might still exist.  |  People from Canada‚Äôs territories were not fully included because there weren‚Äôt enough responses from those areas.  The use of online surveys means people without internet access were excluded, which could affect the results.  |   Small sample size and controlled conditions may not fully reflect wild foraging.   |
