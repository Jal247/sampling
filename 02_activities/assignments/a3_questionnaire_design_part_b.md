# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    Sampling Strategy between thought 1 and thought 2, would like to proceed with the stratified random sampling approach,thought 2.
    The quality of the sample is expected to be high due to the use of a stratified random sampling approach, which increases the likelihood of capturing a diverse and representative cross-section of entry- and lower-level employees across departments. This approach helps ensure that it will collect insights from employees with different roles, experiences, and departmental cultures, which is crucial for understanding the full scope of factors contributing to turnover. However, a few factors could still impact the representativeness of the sample such as bias response, non response from certain employee. 

    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    Based on Part A learned content of considerations of error reduction, survey quality, ethics, etc. I have revised the original survey. Iâ€™ve made adjustments to clarify questions, reduce potential biases, and ensure ethical data collection. Hereâ€™s the updated survey:

Ethics and Anonymity Statement: For ethical transparency, I have added a brief introductory statement clarifying that responses are confidential, and results will only be used for improving employee experiences.


1. On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with your current role at the company?
	1 - Very Dissatisfied
	2 - Dissatisfied
	3 - Neutral
	4 - Satisfied
	5 - Very Satisfied
   
2. Which factors contribute most to your job satisfaction? (Select all that apply)
	Compensation
	Work-Life Balance
	Career Growth Opportunities
	Team and Management Support
	Company Culture
	Job Security
	Other (please specify)

3. How likely are you to recommend this company as a good place to work to friends or colleagues?
	1 - Not Likely
	2 - Slightly Likely
	3 - Neutral
	4 - Likely
	5 - Very Likely

Reason for change: Added "Slightly Likely" to capture more granular perspectives on willingness to recommend the company. This helps reduce response bias by offering a neutral middle option for more precise measurement
   
4. How would you rate the work-life balance at the company?
	Excellent
	Good
	Fair
	Poor

5. How frequently do you feel stressed or overworked in your role?
	Almost Never
	Rarely
	Sometimes
	Often
	Always
Reason for change: Frequency of Stress, Added "Almost Never" to ensure responses capture a full range of experiences, including employees who may rarely experience stress. This reduces response error by preventing assumptions about universal stress levels

6. In your opinion, how well does the company foster a positive workplace culture?
	1 - Not Well
	2 - Slightly Well
	3 - Neutral
	4 - Well
	5 - Very Well
   
7. How satisfied are you with the support and feedback you receive from your manager?
	1 - Not Satisfied
	2 - Slightly Satisfied
	3 - Neutral
	4 - Satisfied
	5 - Very Satisfied

8. Do you feel there are clear growth opportunities within the company?
	Yes
	Somewhat
	No   

9. What improvements would you like to see in the workplace? (Open-ended)

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
The purpose of the surveyâ€”to understand why employees in entry- and lower-level roles are leaving and what can be done to make them more satisfiedâ€”would be hard to achieve with an observational study alone. Hereâ€™s why:

Getting Direct Feedback: Observing employees can show patterns like attendance or turnover rates, but it doesnâ€™t reveal why employees feel dissatisfied, stressed, or unsupported. A survey allows employees to share these personal thoughts directly.

Understanding Complex Reasons: Many factors behind turnover, like lack of career growth or poor management support, arenâ€™t visible from the outside. These are internal issues that employees need to explain themselves, which is why a survey works better.

Collecting Improvement Ideas: The survey includes an open-ended question for employees to suggest specific changes theyâ€™d like. Observing doesnâ€™t give employees a chance to share their own ideas for improvement.

Anonymity for Honest Responses: In a survey, employees can answer anonymously, which helps them feel safe giving honest feedback. With observation, they may act differently if they know someone is watching, which could distort the results.

In short, while observing might show us some basic patterns, it wouldnâ€™t give us the full picture. A survey is essential to understand employeesâ€™ feelings and ideas, which are key for making meaningful changes to reduce turnover.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
