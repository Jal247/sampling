### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `# 1 You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to understand the factors contributing to the high turnover rate in entry- and lower-level positions at the company. By collecting insights on employee satisfaction, work environment, and potential areas for improvement, the HR department trgeting to identify actionable changes that can enhance job satisfaction and that result in employee retention.

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population:  Entry- and lower-level employees currently employed at the company.

Sampling Frame: Employees across various departments with entry- and lower-level roles. This will include employees who have been with the company for under 2-3 years, as they represent the group most affected by turnover.

Sampling Units: Each employee in an entry- or lower-level position represents a sampling unit.

Sampling Strategy:

thought 1: we can use a simple random sampling strategy to ensure a representative sample of employees across different departments and to gather diverse perspectives on factors affecting satisfaction and turnover.

thought 2:
The survey will use a stratified random sampling approach to ensure representation across departments. This will help capture a range of experiences and identify department-specific issues.
